The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive B2B website for Azellar, starting from product requirements, design system setup, and core page development. Key initial steps included color extraction from the provided logo, installation of essential frontend dependencies like  and , and systematic creation of all defined pages (Home, About, Services, Support, Academy, Contact, FAQ). After an initial build and positive testing, the user requested advanced features (Option 1: Blog, Client Portal, Advanced Forms, Live Chat, Testimonials Slider, Interactive Service Calculator) and interactive elements (Option 3: 3D animations, interactive diagrams, infographics). The engineer implemented these, initially facing performance issues with 3D components, which were then optimized to a 2D fallback. The most recent phase involved implementing a dark theme, a blog content management system, and providing Netlify deployment guidance. The current work explicitly addresses a user-reported bug where the dark theme only affected the navigation, with ongoing efforts to integrate it across all body components.

<product_requirements>
The user required a modern, fast, clean, and SEO-optimized B2B website for Azellar, a database consulting and DevOps company. The design inspiration was Cloudways, emphasizing a unique brand style. Key objectives included building trust with B2B clients, simplifying complex services, offering multiple CTAs, and enhancing UX with animations and clean layouts.

The website structure was defined to include:
*   **Home Page:** Taglines, animated hero, client logos, service preview, testimonials, footer.
*   **About Us:** Vision, mission, values, team bios, CTA.
*   **Services:** Modular cards for 8 specific services.
*   **Support:** Comparison table (Standard, Professional, Enterprise), Get Support form, login logic.
*   **Azellar Akademy:** Workshop list, training benefits, CTA.
*   **Contact Page:** Form, contact details (email, phone, WhatsApp, addresses).
*   **FAQs:** Common questions and answers.
*   **(Optional) Blog/Resources:** For future growth.

The initial build successfully delivered all these core pages with premium design principles, including extracted brand colors, modern typography, glass-morphism effects, Framer Motion animations, responsive design, and professional image integration. Subsequent user requests led to the implementation of advanced features like a Blog/Resources section, an Interactive Service Calculator, a Client Portal, a Live Chat Widget, an Advanced Testimonials Slider (text-based), and an Advanced Contact Form. Interactive elements included an optimized 2D animated database visualization and various scroll-triggered animations. Most recently, the user requested a dark theme setting, guidance on blog content management, and GitHub to Netlify deployment steps. The dark theme is currently being fully integrated across all pages after an initial partial implementation.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard React project structure under .



-   : Manages project dependencies (, , , , , , , , ) and scripts. Essential for setting up the development environment.
-   : Configures Tailwind CSS, including Azellar's custom color palette (navy, teal, aqua, white, dark charcoal) and enabling dark mode support (). This is crucial for consistent styling and theme toggling.
-   : The main React component, responsible for setting up routing (using React Router implicitly, though not explicitly mentioned as installed, common with Next.js App Router concept for page components) and global providers like . It integrates the  and  components.
-   : The entry point of the React application.
-   : Contains all main page components (, , , , , , , , ). Each page is responsible for its content and layout, integrating various components.  is particularly complex, incorporating the , , and .
-   : Houses reusable UI components like , , , , , , , , . These components encapsulate specific functionalities and visual elements.
-   : Manages the application's dark/light theme state, allowing global access to theme preferences and toggle functionality. It persists the theme choice to local storage.
-   : A centralized JavaScript file storing blog article content as an array of objects. This simplifies content management for the blog section.
-   : Provides instructions on how to add new blog content to .
-   : Outlines the steps for deploying the application from GitHub to Netlify.
-   : Netlify-specific configuration file for optimized builds, redirects, and headers.

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation of dark theme across all components and pages. The user explicitly stated the dark theme was only affecting the menu, not the body, and requested a fix.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on fixing an issue where the dark theme functionality was only applying to the navigation menu and not to the main body content of the Azellar website. The engineer recognized this as a critical bug and has been systematically updating various page and component files to ensure proper dark mode support across the entire application.

Specific actions involved:
-   Updating  to ensure its elements and sections correctly respond to the dark theme ().
-   Updating  to integrate dark mode styling ().
-   Updating  for dark theme compatibility ().
-   Updating  to correctly apply dark mode styles ().
-   Continuing to update main pages like  and  ().
-   Updating other components like  and the  page ().
-   Updating  to complete its dark mode implementation ().

The work is ongoing, with the last user message, continue from last process, reinforcing the need to complete the dark theme integration across all remaining components and pages. The aim is to ensure all elements respect the user's selected theme preference seamlessly.
