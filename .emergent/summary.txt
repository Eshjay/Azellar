The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and expanded the Azellar B2B website. Initially, core pages were developed with a custom design system, including dark theme integration, which required several fixes across components. Performance optimizations for hero sections and scroll-to-top navigation were also implemented. A significant phase involved building a student account and course enrollment system using Supabase and Resend, requiring extensive file creation and environment variable configuration. Finally, the engineer began addressing a new set of critical bugs related to the Academy page (e.g., Book Session button, course loading), blog routing, contact form submission, and client support access control. The current work is focused on resolving these newly identified issues, starting with the Academy page.

The user initially required a modern, fast, clean, and SEO-optimized B2B website for Azellar, a database consulting and DevOps company, inspired by Cloudways. Core objectives included building trust, simplifying services, enhancing UX with animations, and providing multiple CTAs. Key pages were Home, About, Services, Support, Academy, Contact, and FAQs. The initial build delivered these with a custom design system (brand colors, typography, glass-morphism, Framer Motion, responsive design).

Subsequent enhancements included a Blog/Resources section, Interactive Service Calculator, Client Portal, Live Chat Widget, Advanced Testimonials Slider, and Advanced Contact Form. Interactive elements like 2D animated database visualization and scroll-triggered animations were added. More recently, the user requested a dark theme (which was partially implemented and fixed), guidance on blog content management, and Netlify deployment steps.

The latest major expansion requested a student account system and course enrollment for Azellar Akademy, including user registration/login, protected dashboards, dynamic course listings from a database, enrollment functionality with email confirmations, and an enhanced contact form. The user specified Next.js + Tailwind CSS for frontend, Supabase for Auth/Backend/DB, Resend for email, and Netlify for hosting. Key pages defined were , , , , , and .

Currently, the user has reported several bugs: Book Session button on Academy page not working, Failed to load courses error, Unable to update profile error, Blog page routing failures, Contact form submission failures (with a request to restore previous design), and a new requirement to restrict client support account creation to admins only.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a bug-fixing sprint, addressing a new set of critical issues reported by the user. The primary focus was on the Book Session button functionality on the Azellar Academy page, which was reported as unresponsive and needed to redirect users to registration or login, followed by a redirection to the dashboard or selected course.

The engineer's specific actions included:
-   Initial attempt to locate and modify the Book Session button in  (Chat Message 243-247).
-   Encountering and attempting to fix linting/parsing errors related to /declare -x DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive"

-   Due to persistent structural issues and linting errors, the engineer decided to recreate the  file, leading to the creation of  (Chat Message 254). This indicates that the previous  file might be in a broken state, and the engineer is starting fresh on a new file to implement the fix.

The work is currently in progress, specifically on resolving the Book Session button functionality and the underlying code structure issues in the Academy page.
